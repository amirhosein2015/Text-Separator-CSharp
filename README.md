## 💡 Project Inspiration

While working on one of my previous projects, I realized that **Microsoft Word lacks a feature** to divide large documents into smaller sections.  
After searching extensively, I found that **no existing software** could effectively split large Word books or novels into custom-sized chunks.

This functionality offers **many advantages** — such as easier editing, faster loading, and better file organization — so I decided to design and develop **Text Separator** to fill this gap.  
I hope you’ll find it useful and enjoyable! 😊
